-moduledoc """
Creator-side tunnel construction for `m:i2p_tunnel_srv`: outbound and inbound
ECIES builds, OTBRM processing, and the returning-STB validation that
activates local inbound tunnels.

The functions here are pure state transformers over
`t:i2p_tunnel_srv:tunnel_srv_state/0` — they pick hops from the NetDb,
generate fresh tunnel IDs, encrypt per-record build requests via `m:i2p_ecies`,
wrap them in garlic via `m:i2p_garlic`, and send the STB (type 25) to the
first hop through `m:i2p_peer`. Replies are matched by I2NP message ID and
peeled via `m:i2p_tunnel:process_otbrm/2`; an all-zero ret-code set activates
the tunnel.

## Usage

These functions are called by the `m:i2p_tunnel_srv` GenServer and its
`m:i2p_tunnel_relay` / `m:i2p_tunnel_publish` helpers, not directly by user
code:

```erlang
%% Queue an outbound 3-hop build from a handle_cast clause
State1 = i2p_tunnel_build:do_build_outbound(State),

%% Queue an inbound build of exactly 2 remote hops
State2 = i2p_tunnel_build:do_build_inbound(State1, 2),

%% Queue an exploratory 2-hop outbound build for the lookup pool.
State3 = i2p_tunnel_build:do_build_outbound(State2, 2, exploratory),

%% An OTBRM arrived over the wire: match it against pending builds
State4 = i2p_tunnel_build:handle_otbrm(Msg, State3).
```

The `pool` tag (`client` or `exploratory`) travels with every build: the
pool tick routes `client` tunnels into the regular `tunnels` / `inbound`
maps used by client traffic, while `exploratory` tunnels land in the
`exploratory` / `exploratory_in` maps used for NetDb lookups. All
public entry points default to the `client` pool, so manual builds and
existing callers are unaffected.
