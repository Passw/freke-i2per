-module(i2p_peer).

-moduledoc """
The peer connection manager: owns the node's connections — NTCP2 and, when the
router operator enables it, SSU2 — both dialed (outbound) and accepted
(inbound, from the boot listeners) — sends and answers I2NP NetDb messages,
populates the local NetDb, and forwards non-DB I2NP messages (garlic, tunnel
data, tunnel gateway, OTBRM) to the tunnel manager (`m:i2p_tunnel_srv`).

This module owns the router's peer connections and NetDb-facing I2NP traffic.
It is a `gen_server` registered locally as `i2p_peer`, a `permanent` child of
`m:i2per_sup`. Each connection is one transport session process spawned under
the matching supervisor (`m:i2p_ntcp2_conn` under `m:i2p_ntcp2_sup`,
`m:i2p_ssu2_conn` under `m:i2p_ssu2_sup`); the peer manager monitors them and
handles their ready, frame, and data messages.

## Transport selection

Outbound dials run in a spawned process and prefer SSU2: when app env
`i2per` -> `ssu2_enabled` is set, the local SSU2 listener is up, and the
remote publishes a usable SSU2 address, the manager attempts the SSU2
handshake there. The handshake blocks until it succeeds or fails; on failure
(SessionCreated timeout, protocol error, or an attempt at a dead SSU2 port)
the dial falls back to NTCP2 without retrying SSU2. When SSU2 is unavailable
(disabled, no listener, or the remote is NTCP2-only) the dial goes straight
to NTCP2. The live transport is surfaced per peer by `f:status/0`.

Inbound sessions arrive from the boot listener as `bob`-role connections. The
ready message carries the dialer's RouterInfo: when the connection's pid does
not match any peer under our own outbound bookkeeping, the manager registers
it as an inbound session (one live session per peer hash — a newer session
replaces the older), learns the dialer's RouterInfo into the NetDb, announces
our own RouterInfo back, and routes its frames like an outbound session. When
no outbound connection is live, `f:send_when_ready/2` messages travel over the
inbound session instead of being queued.

A connection dies on its own (bad peer, closed socket) and the manager only
ever observes that death via a monitor; it then waits out an exponential
backoff before retrying (outbound connections only). Recovery and
reconnection live here, above the connections, never inside them.

The manager connects to seeds, performs exploratory
`m:i2p_i2np:db_lookup/4` round-trips, fills the NetDb from
DatabaseSearchReply and DatabaseStore messages, answers inbound RouterInfo
and LeaseSet2 lookups, sends DeliveryStatus acknowledgements when requested,
and publishes its RouterInfo to the closest floodfills
(`f:publish_floodfills/0`). Every peer connection receives the local
RouterInfo. The periodic refresh timer (`?REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECONDS`) re-signs
and republishes it to the three closest floodfills.

At boot the manager fires a one-shot, bounded floodfill-discovery kick (a
short delay after `init`, `?FLOODFILL_DISCOVERY_KICK_MS` default, overridable
via app env `i2per` -> `floodfill_discovery_delay_ms`). It selects at most
three eligible floodfills and sends exploratory lookups toward them; when the
NetDb has no eligible floodfill yet it falls back to at most three dialable
known seeds. The reseed worker calls `f:discover/0` after its RouterInfos have
traversed the manager, so the same bounded discovery runs after a successful
fresh-client reseed instead of relying on a boot-time race. Incoming
RouterInfos are remembered but are not dialed automatically; this prevents a
75-router reseed bundle from turning into 75 outbound sessions.

Inbound garlic (type 11), tunnel data (type 18), tunnel gateway (type 19), and
OTBRM (type 26) messages are forwarded to `m:i2p_tunnel_srv` when that service
is registered. This routes tunnel build and relay operations through the
current supervisor tree.

%% boot supplies the identity from disk; callers can construct one explicitly.

%% Kick off an exploratory discovery toward one seed.
i2p_peer:lookup(SeedHash, exploratory),

%% Ask a specific peer for its RouterInfo or LeaseSet.
i2p_peer:lookup(PeerHash, routerinfo),
i2p_peer:lookup(PeerHash, leaseset),

%% Ensure our RouterInfo is sent to a peer.
i2p_peer:publish(PeerHash),

%% Publish our RouterInfo to the 3 closest eligible floodfills, asking each
%% for a DeliveryStatus acknowledgement.
i2p_peer:publish_floodfills(),

%% Shut the manager down.

%% learn_ri/2 — record an out-of-band RouterInfo (reseed) without dialling it.
%%
%% The NetDb can refuse a RouterInfo, and that outcome used to be discarded
%% here, so a refused reseed was indistinguishable from an accepted one:
%% remember_ri/2 added it to the known list either way and nothing was logged.
%% A silently failing reseed then looked exactly like a working one, and the
%% only symptom was a NetDb that never reached min_routers.
%%
%% Outcomes split in two. `older` means an equal-or-newer copy is already
%% stored, so the RouterInfo IS in the NetDb and remembering it is correct. The
%% clock rejections, `from_future` and `too_old`, mean it is not, so log those
%% and leave it out of the known list rather than treating it as dialable.
